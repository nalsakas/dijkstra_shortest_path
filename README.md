# dijkstra_shortest_path
Find dijkstra shorted path for a given edge list

## Problem Statement:
Implemet Dijkstra Algorith in Python to find out the shortest path for a given adge list of a graph.
Edges in graph are birectional and have weights (costs) on them.

                A
              /     \
           B    __   D
           |       / |
           |     /   |
           |   /     |
           E  ____   F
            \       /  
             \    /
               C

## Solution:
Implement Dijkstra Algorith in Python.
